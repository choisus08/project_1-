### **Difficulties & Problem Solving**

---

</br>

- Rendering the product search onto the browser
- Creating the app to be responsive across a multitude of devices

- I collaborated with a fellow cohort student to resolve the rendering of the actual searches. We used a similar skeleton for our code in order to achieve this goal.
